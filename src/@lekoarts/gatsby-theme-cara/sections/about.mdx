## What is WAIS?

> WAIS or Women in Information Systems is a BYU Marriott School of Business club for women in the Information Systems program (but we love the boys too)

The purpose of WAIS is to create a community of women within the Information Systems major. IS is a heavily male dominate major and field. There are fantastic guys in our major but I would be lying to you if I didn't say I missed being around a lot of other girls every day. So WAIS allows women that opportunity to surround themselves with women!
